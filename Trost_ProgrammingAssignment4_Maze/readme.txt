Programming Assignment 4 -- Maze

Program runs find both from the console or running from visual studios. It compiles entirely find and 
will run all without commandin console, or in visual studios it will operate on its own after
an n is entered. The program will print out the maze, do both a BFS and a DFS, then print out
a miniature display of the path generated using X's, then it will exit. If you run the program from command
you can enter a text document by typing "Trost_ProgrammingAssignment4_Maze Maze#.txt"
Or you can have the program create its own maze by just typing in the name of the .exe.
